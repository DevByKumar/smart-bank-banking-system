## üîÑ Application & User Flows

This project is built on two primary user flows:

### 1. New User Registration & KYC Approval

This flow ensures no user can access the system until they are verified by an admin.

1.  **Customer (Sign Up):** A new user registers by submitting their personal details (name, email, password) and uploading (simulated) KYC documents.
2.  **System:** Creates a new user in the database with a `status: "pending_approval"`.
3.  **Admin (Review):** The admin logs in and sees a list of all "pending" users in their dashboard. They can review the submitted details.
4.  **Admin (Action):** The admin chooses to **Approve (‚úÖ)** or **Reject (‚ùå)** the user's application.
5.  **System:** The user's status is updated to `"approved"` or `"rejected"`.
6.  **Customer (Log In):** The user can now log in *only if* their status is `"approved"`.

### 2. Loan Application Flow

This flow allows approved customers to apply for loans, which are then reviewed by an admin.

1.  **Customer (Dashboard):** The customer logs into their dashboard and clicks "Apply for Loan".
2.  **Customer (Form):** They fill out a form with:
    * Loan Type (e.g., Personal, Home)
    * Loan Amount
    * Loan Tenure (in months)
3.  **System:**
    * Validates the form data.
    * Calculates the estimated **EMI** using the formula: `EMI = (P * r * (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)`.
    * Saves the application to the database with a `status: "pending"`.
4.  **Admin (Review):** The admin sees a new "pending" loan application in their dashboard.
5.  **Admin (Action):** The admin reviews the application and the customer's profile, then chooses to **Approve (‚úÖ)** or **Reject (‚ùå)** the loan.
6.  **Customer (Status):** The customer sees their loan status (e.g., "Approved", "Rejected") updated in their dashboard.
